## 10. Projects
When Gordon Ramsay was learning how to cook he worked as a line cook on a restaurant 5 days a week, and went to culinary school on the 7th.
We will use a similar approach.
The majority of your time should be spent on your projects. 
This is a great resource for your first 10 project ideas:
[Top 10 Projects for Practice](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/top-10-projects-for-beginners-to-practice-html-and-css-skills/).
But, don’t limit yourself to the examples given - for example, if find a website you like - copy it.

## 1 Book

([Learning Web Design: A Beginner’s Guide to HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web Graphics](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Web-Design-Beginners-JavaScript/dp/1491960205/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&keywords=jennifer+robbins+html&qid=1592572936&s=books&sr=1-1&linkCode=sl1&tag=csstricks-20&linkId=6010469f2458957ccbe405b0a389e373&language=en_US))

You don’t need to read the whole book - read it up to Chapter 18, 30 minutes up to an hour a day, after you spent time actually building.

## 1 Course 

You also need the basics of computer science:
Watch one of these video from
[Harvard’s CS 50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/) every weekend.


## And that is it:
Build projects every day - spend ⅔ of your time actually writing code, if you don’t know how to do something - google it, and repeat until you have a website.
Read the book every day with the extra ⅓ of your available time, and what CS50 once a week.
